# Python-Instacart-Analysis
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of Instacart sales. It pulls from Instacart's public orders data merged with fictional customer data to inform strategy and recommendations for the company. 

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The company has very good sales, but wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their data along with their purchasing behaviors.

I was tasked with coducting an initial data and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation. 

Key Business Questions:
1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
2. They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
5. The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief
have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are
ordering, and anything else you can think of.

I used open-source data sets from Instacart in conjunction with a fictional customer data set for the purposes of this project. 

After conducting data wrangling, subsetting, and consistency checks, I began data transformation efforts. This included combining and exporting data, deriving new variables, grouping/aggregating, and creating visualizations. 

A few example visualizations included below. Final project zip file (including project brief, scripts, visualization PNGs, and a final Excel report for Instacart) is attached in this depository. Data file is omitted as it is too large for GitHub to hold in project folder. 

Example visualizations:

Note: all visualizations are in the "Analysis" folder of the project zip file included in this depository.
